    Get the utility object for querying elevation data.

    All data files will be stored in localy (note that it may be 
    gigabytes of data so clean it from time to time).

    On first run -- all files needed url will be stored and for every next 
    elevation query if the SRTM file is not found it will be retrieved and 
    saved.

    If you need to change the way the files are saved locally (for example if 
    you need to save them locally) -- change the file_handler. See 
    srtm.main.FileHandler.

    If leave_zipped is True then files will be stored locally as compressed 
    zip files. That means less disk space but more computing space for every 
    file loaded.

    If use_included_urls is True urls to SRTM files included in the library 
    will be used. Set to false if you need to reload them on first run.

    With srtm1 or srtm3 params you can decide which SRTM format to use. Srtm3 
    has a resolution of three arc-seconds (cca 90 meters between points). 
    Srtm1 has a resolution of one arc-second (cca 30 meters). Srtm1 is 
    available only for the United states. If both srtm1 ans srtm2 are True and 
    both files are present for a location -- the srtm1 will be used.
